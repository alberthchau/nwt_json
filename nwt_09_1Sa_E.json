I am a woman under great stress; I have not drunk wine or anything alcoholic, but I am pouring out my soul before Jehovah."},{"Verse":16,"Text":" Do not take your servant for a worthless woman, for I have been speaking until now out of my great anguish and distress.”"},{"Verse":17,"Text":" Then Eʹli answered: “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.”"},{"Verse":18,"Text":" To this she said: “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” And the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast."},{"Verse":19,"Text":" Then they got up early in the morning and bowed before Jehovah, after which they returned to their house in Raʹmah.

Stay at home until you wean him.

Why do you keep honoring your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the best portions of every offering of my people Israel?"},{"Verse":30,"Text":" “‘That is why the word of Jehovah the God of Israel is: “I did indeed say that your house and the house of your forefather would always walk before me.” But now Jehovah declares: “It is unthinkable, on my part, because those honoring me I will honor, but those despising me will be treated with contempt.”"},{"Verse":31,"Text":" Look!
