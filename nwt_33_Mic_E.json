Jacob?\r\nIs it not Samarʹia?\r\nAnd what are the high places of Judah?\r\nAre they not Jerusalem?"},{"Verse":6,"Text":" I will make Samarʹia a heap of ruins of the field,\r\nA place for planting

daughter of Zion,\r\nFor in you were found the revolts of Israel."},{"Verse":14,"Text":" So you will give parting gifts to Moʹresheth-gath.\r\nThe houses of Achʹzib were something deceitful to the

devastated!\r\nHe caused the portion of my people to change hands—how he removes it from me!\r\nTo the unfaithful one he assigns our fields.”"},{"Verse":5,"Text":" So you will have no one to stretch the measuring cord,\r\nTo allot the land in the congregation of Jehovah."},{"Verse":6,"Text":" “Stop preaching!” they preach,\r\n“They should not preach these things;\r\nHumiliation will not overtake us!”"},{"Verse":7,"Text":" Is it being said, O house of Jacob:\r\n“Has the spirit of Jehovah become impatient?\r\nAre these his deeds?”\r\nDo not my own words bring good to those walking uprightly?"},{"Verse":8,"Text":" But lately my own people have risen up as an enemy.\r\nYou openly strip off the majestic ornament with the garment\r\nFrom those passing by confidently, like those returning from war."},{"Verse":9,"Text":" You drive the women of my people out from their delightful houses;\r\nFrom their children you take away my splendor forever."},{"Verse":10,"Text":" Get up and go, for this is no place of rest.\r\nBecause of uncleanness, there is destruction, grievous destruction."},{"Verse":11,"Text":" If a man walks after wind and deception and tells this lie:\r\n“I will

skin,\r\nSmashing their bones, crushing them to pieces,\r\nLike what is cooked in a pot, like meat in a cooking pot."},{"Verse":4,"Text":" At that time they will call to Jehovah for help,\r\nBut he will not answer them.\r\nHe will hide his face from them at that time,\r\nBecause of their wicked deeds."},{"Verse":5,"Text":" This is what Jehovah says against the prophets who are leading my people astray,\r\nWho proclaim ‘Peace!’ while they bite with their teeth\r\nBut who declare war against him who puts nothing into their mouths:"},{"Verse":6,"Text":" ‘You will have night; there will be no vision;\r\nThere will only be darkness for you, no divination.\r\nThe sun will set on the prophets,\r\nAnd the day will turn dark for them."},{"Verse":7,"Text":" The visionaries will be put to shame,\r\nAnd the diviners will be disappointed.\r\nAll of them will have to cover over the mustache,\r\nFor there is no answer from God.’”"},{"Verse":8,"Text":" As for me, I am filled with power by the spirit of Jehovah,\r\nAnd with justice and might,\r\nTo tell to Jacob his revolt and to Israel his sin."},{"Verse":9,"Text":" Hear this, please, you heads of the house of Jacob\r\nAnd you commanders of the house of Israel,\r\nWho detest justice and who make crooked all that is straight,"},{"Verse":10,"Text":" Who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with

firmly established above the top of the mountains,\r\nAnd it will be raised up above the hills,\r\nAnd to it peoples will stream."},{"Verse":2,"Text":" And many nations will go and say:\r\n“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah\r\nAnd to the house of the God of Jacob.\r\nHe will instruct us about his ways,\r\nAnd we will walk in his paths.”\r\nFor law will go out of Zion,\r\nAnd the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem."},{"Verse":3,"Text":" He will render judgment among many peoples\r\nAnd set matters straight respecting mighty nations far away.\r\nThey will beat their swords into plowshares\r\nAnd their spears into pruning shears.\r\nNation will not lift up sword against nation,\r\nNor will they learn war anymore."},{"Verse":4,"Text":" They will sit, each one under his vine

one,\r\nAlong with those I treated harshly."},{"Verse":7,"Text":" I will make the one who was limping a remnant,\r\nAnd the one far removed a mighty nation;\r\nAnd Jehovah will rule as king over them in Mount Zion,\r\nFrom now on and forever."},{"Verse":8,"Text":" As for you, O tower of the flock,\r\nThe mound of the daughter of Zion,\r\nTo you it will come, yes, the first dominion will come,\r\nThe kingdom belonging to the daughter of Jerusalem."},{"Verse":9,"Text":" Now why are you shouting loudly?\r\nHave you no king,\r\nOr has your adviser perished,\r\nSo that pain has seized you

far as to Babylon,\r\nAnd there you will be rescued;\r\nThere Jehovah will buy you back from the hand of your enemies."},{"Verse":11,"Text":" Now many nations will be gathered against you;\r\nThey will say, ‘Let her be defiled,\r\nAnd let our eyes see this happen to Zion.’"},{"Verse":12,"Text":" But they do not know the thoughts of Jehovah,\r\nThey do not understand his purpose;\r\nFor he will gather them like a row of newly cut grain to the threshing floor."},{"Verse":13,"Text":" Get up and thresh, O daughter of Zion;\r\nFor I will change your horns into iron,\r\nAnd I will change your hooves into copper,\r\nAnd you will pulverize many peoples.\r\nYou will devote their dishonest profit to Jehovah,\r\nAnd their resources to the true Lord of the whole earth.”"}]},{"Chapter":5,"Verses":[{"Verse":1,"Text":" “Now you are slashing yourself,\r\nO daughter under attack;\r\nA siege is laid against us.\r\nWith a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek."},{"Verse":2,"Text":" And you, O Bethʹlehem Ephʹrathah,\r\nThe one too little to be among the thousands of Judah,\r\nFrom you will come out for me the one to be ruler in Israel,\r\nWhose origin is from ancient times, from the days of long ago."},{"Verse":3,"Text":" So he will give them up\r\nUntil the time that she who is to give birth has given birth.\r\nAnd the rest of his brothers will

entrances.\r\nAnd he will rescue us from the Assyrʹian,\r\nWhen he invades our land and treads on our territory."},{"Verse":7,"Text":" The remaining ones of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples\r\nLike dew from Jehovah,\r\nLike showers of rain on vegetation\r\nThat do not put hope in man\r\nOr wait for the sons of men."},{"Verse":8,"Text":" The remaining ones of Jacob will be among the nations,\r\nIn the midst of many peoples,\r\nLike a lion among the beasts of a forest,\r\nLike a young lion among flocks of sheep,\r\nThat passes through and pounces and tears in pieces;\r\nAnd
